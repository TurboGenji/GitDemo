Day by day I feel the same.
Searching star to see my fate.
I am looking here for myself.
I am looking for some sense.
But only I find in the space
some falling stars and trays!
Where are you now,
my childhood from the past?
Where are you now,
my final neural cell?

Stars! Stars are falling down!
Falling down the sky!
Falling just like me!
In my fantasies!
May I find some peace!
May I find some rest!
While I'm feeling lonely 
Talking with my friends!

My life's fading just like dream.
I'm forgetting how to sleep.
But I keep looking in the dust
For precious memories.
Coming back to the start
